		<h3>ThreeDo</h3>
		<p>I wrote this as a demo application using Backbone.js. It's got a few more rules than your basic to-do: tasks in the <em>To Do</em> column can't be dragged straight to <em>Done</em> without a stop in <em>In Progress</em>.</p>

		<h3>Find On Page</h3>
		<p>Written as a mobile-friendly exercise, this toolbar emulates the <em>Find on Page...</em> tool in Firefox.</p>

		<h3>Flatbox</h3>
		<p>Another exercise in JavaScript plugins made to be friendly to mobile devices: a simple image slideshow that cycles through all images on a page.</p>
