<h2>This is me.</h2>
<ol>
	<li>I'm a JavaScript &amp; Python developer in San Francisco. Before that, Brooklyn. I'm originally from Seattle.</li>
	<li><p>I believe passionately in eliminating dependence on cars and making cities friendly for transit, bicycles, and pedestrians.</p><p>Car-oriented planning worsens global poverty, makes cities unlivable, and is a critical root of climate change.</p></li>
	<li>Bicycles are excellent. Also coffee.</li>
	<li>I'm bilingual in English and Spanish and have been a UX designer, UI localizer, &amp; accessibility researcher.</li>
	<li>Hackerspaces and free culture bring me joy. Building beautiful things keeps me going.</li>
	<li>I'm a feminist and a creator-participant in tech communities for girls, women, &amp; genderqueer people.</li>
	<li>Sometimes I paint, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tensory" target="_blank">take pictures</a>, climb rocks and trees, and try to cook.</li>
	<li>Equality for all. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam">Tikkun olam</a>. Beginner-mind.</li>
